This source was initially downloaded from http://www.thc.org

In the original source file, there is a copyright notice within the
documentation, however, no license file is actually given.

Robert Lemmen, the Debian package maintainer for this software managed
to find out that the source code  was licenced under the GPL. He also found
out that the file "usenix6-gutmann.doc" was licenced under the "Creative
Commons Attribution 3.0" license, which you can find at 
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/

If this isn't true, let me know and I'll update the information and seek
the correct licensing information.

Robert Lemmen also made additional patches for the Debian version. I have
done more or less the same changes that he did to the Makefile.
